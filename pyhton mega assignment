Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
A26- A string is a sequence of characters 
     str1="giri"
     print(str1)
Q27. How can we access the string using its index?    
A27- Indexing means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. 
Each of a stringâ€™s characters corresponds to an index number and each character can be accessed using its index number. 
We can access characters in a String in Two ways :
Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number
Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number
     w= "giri"
     print(w[1]) #output=i
      w= "giri"
     print(w[-1]) #output -i
Q28- Write a code to get the desired output of the following.
     string = "Big Data iNeuron"
     desired_output = "iNeuron"
A28- string="big data ineuron"
     words = string.split(" ")
     desired_output = words[-1]
     print(desired_output)
     #2nd way-string="Big Data iNeuron" 
              print(string[9:16]) 
              desired_output = "iNeuron"
Q29-  Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
      string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      desired_output = "norueNi"  
A29-string = "Big data iNeuron"
      # Extract the substring "iNeuron"
      substring = string.split(" ")[-1]
      # reverse the substring
      reversed_substring = substring[::-1]
      print(reversed_substring)
      #2nd way-string = "Big Data iNeuron" 
               temp_string = string[-7: ]
               new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
               print(new_string) desired_output = "norueNi"
Q30-Resverse the string given in the above question.
A30-string = "Big Data iNeuron" 
    temp_string = string[:16] 
    new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
    print(new_string)
Q31-How can you delete entire string at once?
A31-we can use del keyword to delete the entire string.
Q32- What is escape sequence?
A32-They are primarily used to put nonprintable characters in character and string literals. For example, you can use escape sequences to put such characters as tab, carriage return, and backspace into an output stream.
Q33-How can you print the below string?
    'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
A33- print("iNeuron's Big Data Course")
Q34-What is a list in Python? 
A34- list is a data structure which is also called collection of items, in which we can store anything like string,float, integer.
Q35-How can you create a list in Python?
A35-1st way-list1=[7,'giri','big data',2023]
            print(list1)
    2nd way-list2= []
            print(type(list2))  
Q36-How can we access the elements in a list?
A36-We can access an element in a list using its index.
Q37-Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
A37-lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
    print(lst[4][2])
Q38- Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
A38- list=[7,9,1995,'giri',5.11]
     print(len(list))
Q39-list1.insert(2,"Big")
    print(list1) 
Q40-What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
A40-A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets. Tuples are immutable.-
Q41-How can you create a tuple in Python?
A41-t1=()
Q42- Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
A42-t1=("giri","raj","dhar")
    t1[3]="giridhar"
    print(t1)
    no its not possible to add a new item in a tuple because it is unchangable .
 Q43-Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
 A43-no tuple cannot be appended because tuple are immutable.
 Q44-Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it
 A44-tup=(22,55,"giri",7)
     print(len(tup))
 Q45-What are sets in Python?
