Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
A26- A string is a sequence of characters 
     str1="giri"
     print(str1)
Q27. How can we access the string using its index?    
A27- Indexing means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. 
Each of a stringâ€™s characters corresponds to an index number and each character can be accessed using its index number. 
We can access characters in a String in Two ways :
Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number
Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number
     w= "giri"
     print(w[1]) #output=i
      w= "giri"
     print(w[-1]) #output -i

     desired_output = words[-1]
     print(desired_output)
     #2nd way-string="Big Data iNeuron" 
              print(string[9:16]) 
              desired_output = "iNeuron"
Q29-  Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
      string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      desired_output = "norueNi"  
A29-string = "Big data iNeuron"
      # Extract the substring "iNeuron"
      substring = string.split(" ")[-1]
      # reverse the substring
      reversed_substring = substring[::-1]
      print(reversed_substring)
      #2nd way-string = "Big Data iNeuron" 
               temp_string = string[-7: ]
               new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
               print(new_string) desired_output = "norueNi"

    new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
    print(new_string)
Q31-How can you delete entire string at once?
A31-we can use del keyword to delete the entire string.
Q32- What is escape sequence?
A32-They are primarily used to put nonprintable characters in character and string literals. For example, you can use escape sequences to put such characters as tab, carriage return, and backspace into an output stream.
Q33-How can you print the below string?
    'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
A33- print("iNeuron's Big Data Course")
Q34-What is a list in Python? 
A34- list is a data structure which is also called collection of items, in which we can store anything like string,float, integer.
Q35-How can you create a list in Python?

            print(list1)
    2nd way-list2= []
            print(type(list2))  
Q36-How can we access the elements in a list?
A36-We can access an element in a list using its index.
Q37-Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
A37-lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
    print(lst[4][2])

Q40-What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
A40-A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets. Tuples are immutable.-
Q41-How can you create a tuple in Python?
A41-t1=()

A42-t1=("giri","raj","dhar")
    t1[3]="giridhar"
    print(t1)
    no its not possible to add a new item in a tuple because it is unchangable .
 Q43-Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
 A43-no tuple cannot be appended because tuple are immutable.

 A47-set_g={1,2,3}                         
     set_g.add("iNeuron")
     print(set_g)
 Q48-Try to add multiple values using add() function.
 A48-we cannot add multiple values by using add() function because only one value will be allowed.
 Q49-How is update() different from add()?
 A49-update() put multiple values in your set but add() can't do this.
     update function using[] but add function using()
    set_g={1,2,3}                         
    set_g.update(["iNeuron","giri",7])
    print(set_g)

 A50-It removes all the elements from the set.
 Q51-What is frozen set?
 A51-Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function. As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.
     it has a characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned.
 Q52-How is frozen set different from set?
 A52-Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.
 Q53-What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
 A53-the union() of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set(or both sets).
 A = {2, 4, 5, 6}

 s1 = {1, 2, 3}
 s2 = {2, 3}
print(s1.intersection(s2))

  A69-for loop and while loop
  Q70-What is the difference between for and while loops?
  A70-The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations, that is, how many times a statement must be executed. That is why, when we initialize the for loop, we must define the ending point. A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.

  A72-Break' in Python is a loop control statement. It is used to control the sequence of the loop. Suppose you want to terminate a loop and skip to the next code after the loop; break will help you do that.
  Q73-What is the use of pass statement?
  A73-pass statement is used to do nothing.it can be used inside a loop or if statement to represent no operation. pass is useful when we need statement syntactically correect but we do not want to do any operation.
  Q74-What is the use of range() function?
  A74-The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
