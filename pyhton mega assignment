Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
A26- A string is a sequence of characters 
     str1="giri"
     print(str1)
Q27. How can we access the string using its index?    
A27- Indexing means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. 
Each of a stringâ€™s characters corresponds to an index number and each character can be accessed using its index number. 
We can access characters in a String in Two ways :
Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number
Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number
     w= "giri"
     print(w[1]) #output=i
      w= "giri"
     print(w[-1]) #output -i
Q28- Write a code to get the desired output of the following.
     string = "Big Data iNeuron"
     desired_output = "iNeuron"
A28- string="big data ineuron"
     words = string.split(" ")
     desired_output = words[-1]
     print(desired_output)
     #2nd way-string="Big Data iNeuron" 
              print(string[9:16]) 
              desired_output = "iNeuron"
Q29-  Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
      string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      desired_output = "norueNi"  
A29-string = "Big data iNeuron"
      # Extract the substring "iNeuron"
      substring = string.split(" ")[-1]
      # reverse the substring
      reversed_substring = substring[::-1]
      print(reversed_substring)
      #2nd way-string = "Big Data iNeuron" 
               temp_string = string[-7: ]
               new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
               print(new_string) desired_output = "norueNi"
Q30-Resverse the string given in the above question.
A30-string = "Big Data iNeuron" 
    temp_string = string[:16] 
    new_string = temp_string[::-1] 
    print(new_string)
Q31-How can you delete entire string at once?
A31-we can use del keyword to delete the entire string.
Q32- What is escape sequence?
A32-They are primarily used to put nonprintable characters in character and string literals. For example, you can use escape sequences to put such characters as tab, carriage return, and backspace into an output stream.
Q33-How can you print the below string?
    'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
A33- print("iNeuron's Big Data Course")
Q34-What is a list in Python? 
A34- list is a data structure which is also called collection of items, in which we can store anything like string,float, integer.
Q35-How can you create a list in Python?
A35-1st way-list1=[7,'giri','big data',2023]
            print(list1)
    2nd way-list2= []
            print(type(list2))  
Q36-How can we access the elements in a list?
A36-We can access an element in a list using its index.
Q37-Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
A37-lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
    print(lst[4][2])
Q38- Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
A38- list=[7,9,1995,'giri',5.11]
     print(len(list))
Q39-list1.insert(2,"Big")
    print(list1) 
Q40-What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
A40-A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets. Tuples are immutable.-
Q41-How can you create a tuple in Python?
A41-t1=() 
Q42- Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
A42-t1=("giri","raj","dhar")
    t1[3]="giridhar"
    print(t1)
    no its not possible to add a new item in a tuple because it is unchangable .
 Q43-Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
 A43-no tuple cannot be appended because tuple are immutable.
 Q44-Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it
 A44-tup=(22,55,"giri",7)
     print(len(tup))
 Q45-What are sets in Python?
 A45- Set is a data structure which is  also called collection of items , in which we can represent a group of unique value as a single entity.
 Q46- How can you create a set?
 A46- set_name={1,2,3,4}
      print(type(set_name))
      print(set_name)
 Q47-Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set
 A47-set_g={1,2,3}                         
     set_g.add("iNeuron")
     print(set_g)
 Q48-Try to add multiple values using add() function.
 A48-we cannot add multiple values by using add() function because only one value will be allowed.
 Q49-How is update() different from add()?
 A49-update() put multiple values in your set but add() can't do this.
     update function using[] but add function using()
    set_g={1,2,3}                         
    set_g.update(["iNeuron","giri",7])
    print(set_g)
 Q50-What is clear() in sets?
 A50-It removes all the elements from the set.
 Q51-What is frozen set?
 A51-Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function. As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.
     it has a characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned.
 Q52-How is frozen set different from set?
 A52-Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.
 Q53-What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
 A53-the union() of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set(or both sets).
 A = {2, 4, 5, 6} 
 B = {4, 6, 7, 8} 
print("A U B:", A.union(B))
 Q54- What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
 A54- The intersection contains all the element in both sets.
 s1 = {1, 2, 3}
 s2 = {2, 3}
print(s1.intersection(s2))
 Q55-What is dictionary in Python?
 A55-Dictionary is a data structure in which we represent a group of object as key value pair.
 Syntax- dict-name = {key:value}
 Q56-How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
 A56-dictionary stores data in key-value pairs
 Q57-How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
 A57-my_info={"name":"giridhar","Age":27,"city":"varanasi"}
     print(my_info)
 Q58-What will the output of the following?
     var = {} 
     print(type(var))
 A58-:it will print dict type   
 Q59-How can we add an element in a dictionary?
 A59-my_info={"name":"giridhar","Age":27,"city":"varanasi"}
     my_info['Occupation']='Job'
     print(my_info)
 Q60-Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
 A60- my_info={"name":"giridhar","Age":27,"city":"varanasi"}

     # Access all values in the dictionary using the values() method
      all_values = my_info.values()

      # Print all the values
       print(all_values)
  Q61-Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
  A61-my_info={"name":"giridhar","Age":27,"city":"varanasi",
     "my_info2":{"name":"Nidhi","Age":26,"city":"varanasi"}}
      # Access all values in the dictionary using the values() method
      all_values = my_info.values()
      # Print all the values
      print(all_values)
  Q62-What is the use of get() function?  
  A62-this method returns the value of the specified key.
  Q63-What is the use of items() function?
  A63-this method returns an object that contains key-value pairs of dictionary.
  Q64- What is the use of pop() function?
  A64-this method is used to remove last element from the existing list.
  Q65-What is the use of popitems() function
  A65-this method is used to remove the item which was last inserted into the dictionary.
  Q66-What is the use of keys() function?
  A66-this method returns a sequence of keys from the dictionary.
  Q67- What is the use of values() function.
  A67-this method returns a sequence of values from the dictionary.
  Q68-What are loops in Python?
  A68-loops are conditional statement which is used to execute a statement a given number of times.
  Q69-How many type of loop are there in Python?
  A69-for loop and while loop
  Q70-What is the difference between for and while loops?
  A70-The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations, that is, how many times a statement must be executed. That is why, when we initialize the for loop, we must define the ending point. A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.
  Q71- What is the use of continue statement?
  A71-The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
  Q72-What is the use of break statement?
  A72-Break' in Python is a loop control statement. It is used to control the sequence of the loop. Suppose you want to terminate a loop and skip to the next code after the loop; break will help you do that.
